	<p>Viruses are microscopic parasites, generally much smaller than bacteria. They lack the capacity to thrive
	 outside of a host body.<br> Predominantly, viruses have a reputation for being the cause of epidemics. Widespread
	 events of diesease and deaths like, the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa
	 and the ongoing COVID-19 are the sure examples for this. While such viruses are surely foes for the scientists
	 and medical professionals; other viruses are usful for them. They use viruses as research tools to understand
	 the mechanics of protein synthesis in the virus itself.</p>

	<p>Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause dieseses in mammals and birds. In humans and birds,
	 they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to fatal. Mild illnesses in humans include
	 common cold, while more fatal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19.<br> Coronaviruses are large, roughly
	 spherical viruses with unique surface projections. Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80
	 to 120 nanometers. They are enclosed in an envelope encapsulated with a number of protein molecules. The
	 viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane, envelope and spike structured proteins are
	 anchored. This protects the virus when its outside the host cell. Th spikes are the most distinguishing
	 features of coronavirus and are responsible for the crown like surface, and hence the name corona. On an average
	 a coronavirus has 74 spikes. Each spike is about 20 nanometers long and is composed of a trimer of the spike
	 protein. Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid
	 protein.</p>

	<p>COVID-19 is not the only epidemic caused by the coronavirues. Actually, these viruses have a very dreadful
	 history. HUman coronavirus was first invented in the mid-1960s. From then, seven types of coronaviruses have been
	 found that can infect humans. These are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>229E (alpha coronavirus)</li>
			<li>NL63 (alpha coronavirus)</li>
			<li>OC43 (beta coronavirus)</li>
			<li>HKU1 (beta coronavirus)</li>
			<li>MERS-CoV (beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)</li>
			<li>SARS-CoV (beta coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)</li>
			<li>SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV(novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus diesease 2019, or COVID-19)</li>
		</ol>
	<p>People around the world get commonly affected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1.<br> But
	 sometimes, coronaviruses that infect animals evole and make peole sick. The recent examples are MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV
	 and 2019-nCoV.<br> The SARS-CoV virus is a strain of coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
	 which infects the epithelial cells within the lungs. It infects humans, bats and palm civets. It was first identified
	 in the year 2003 and caused a major outbreak of SARS diesease at that time.<br> The MERS-CoV virus is the type of
	 type of coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome which is a viral respiratory diesease. It was first
	 identified in Saudi Arabia in the year 2012, and caused a lot of havoc in the whole world. Approximately 35% of the
	 the reported patients died with the MERS diesease.<br> So, we see, that the COVID-19 is not the only coronavirus member
	 that has caused so much panic and devastation, there are other members too that have caused upheavel in the human
	 lives in the past.</p></div>

		<ul>
			<li>Aches and pains</li>
			<li>Sore Throat</li>
			<li>Diarrhoea</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breathe</li>
			<li>Pain in chest</li>
			<li>Loss of speech or movement</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have any of these symptoms. On average it takes 5-6 days from when someone

	<p>People having illnesses like diabetes, kidney problems or heart problems can be affected more by COVID. Also the
	 people who take drugs, the ladies who are in their pregnancy, the elderly, the children and the people with weak immune
	 systems can be affected much easily. So, they should be more cautious and should take more precautions, so that they can
	 protect themselves and others from COVID-19. They should regularly and thoroughly clean their hands with an alcohol-based
	 hand rub or wash them with soap and water. They should avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many
	 surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to their eyes, nose or mouth. From
	 there, the virus can enter their body and infect them. They should also cover they mouth and nose with their bent
	 elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, they can protect the people
	 around them from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19. At last, they shold clean and disinfect surfaces frequently
	 especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens</p>

	 governments also took some early steps to prevent the spread of COVID in their countries like, issuing safety protocols

	<p>A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division,
	 exposure to ionizing radiation, or exposure to chemicals called mutagens.<br> The mutations in all the replicating
	 viruses, including coronavirus enhance the ability of viral infection as well as an escape from host immune attack.
	 It is also found that in the countries which have found a new strain of the virus, the  mortality rate is more. So,
	 it sums up that, virus mutation affects the mortality rate.</p>
